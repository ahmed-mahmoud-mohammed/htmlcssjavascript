<p>Some food sites splash mouth-watering pictures of delicious dishes across their pages and make us want to rush right out to eat.
     Others use the vibrant colors of food as a jumping-off point for a beautiful design. And still others integrate it into the functionality
      of the site, turning food into buttons, page loading devices, and more.</p>

      <h1>Food in Egypt</h1>
      <p>Food is a large part of every country’s culture. So, to get to know more about Egyptian culture, here is a table of 5
           traditional Egyptian dishes that you have to try when visiting Egypt.</p>
           <table>
               <tr><th colspan="2">Food & description</th><th>Price</th></tr>
               <tr><td>Kushari</td><td>A mix of rice, spaghetti, small round macaroni, vermicelli, fried onions, black lentils and hummus, topped with thick tomato sauce, garlic and vinegar sauce, and chilli sauce put together in some kind of art. </td><td>EGP 10-25</td></tr>
           <tr><td>Mulukhiya</td><td>A green leafy vegetable chopped and cooked with garlic in beef, rabbit or chicken stew, and served with rice or bread. One interesting thing about Mulukhiya is that it gets prepared differently in different areas in Egypt.</td><td>EGP 20-40</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Fatta</td><td>The dish consists of layers of fried bread and rice, with tomato sauce cooked with garlic and vinegar on top, meat soup and large pieces of meat. The dish is very delicious but very fattening so only eat on special occasions.</td><td>EGP 60-90</td></tr>    
    <tr><td>Ful Medames</td><td>Ful can be prepared in many different ways, and people eat it with butter, spicy oil, olive oil, tomato sauce, pepper, pastrami, parsley, sausage, and boiled or fried eggs. It is believed that Ful was cooked all the way back in ancient Egypt.</td><td>EGP 10-15</td></tr>    
<tr><td>Kebab & Kofta</td><td>If you’re a meat lover, then this is a must try! Kebab is prepared with pieces of grilled meat (lamb or veal). As for Kofta, it is piece of minced meat and is also prepared on the grill. Both are served with Egyptian bread, salads and tahina.</td><td>EGP 210-280</td></tr>
